!THIS IS VERY UNFINISHED!
This is a playable videogame version of a Finnish card game called "Kusetus". The game is about trying to place cards higher than your opponents, while also having the ability to lie. The game is written in C# using SDL2 for rendering. For multiplayer it uses SignalR and a server which should be on github when I feel like uploading it
